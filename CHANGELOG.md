# Changelog for r4s

Notable changes may be documented in this file.
The format is (loosely) based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this
project more or less adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

* Drafts with the same slug as a post is now cleared only for
  reasonably new posts.
* Remove the metadata fallback from 0.4.0, now "fenced yaml" is the
  only supported metadata format.
* Added a `fediverse:creator` meta tag.


## Release 0.4.2

* Fix a frontpage style bug.


## Release 0.4.0
2025-04-20 00:36 CST

* Major refactor of reading blog source files.
  - Use the markdown parser events more, and do less stuff by regex
    and string manipulation directly on the source.
  - Change behaviour to more type-state.
  - The "fenced yaml" kind of metainformation seems more or less
    standard and is supported by `pulldown-cmark` now, so switch to
    use that (currently with some fallback support for unfenced).
  - New markdown for my figures / images, closer to standard markdown.
    (currently with fallback to my old figures).
* More usefull dumpcomments: Only include public comments.
* Minor follow-up styleing improvements.
* I'm no longer at KTH.
* Use std `LazyLock` instead of macro-based `lazy_static`.
* Updated to `disel` 0.2.2, `disel-async` 0.5, `ructe` to 0.18.0,
  `pulldown-cmark` 0.13.0, and `csrf` 0.5.0.


## Release 0.3.10
2023-06-08 01:54 CST

* Fixed a bug in markdown lists handling.


## Release 0.3.8
2023-06-08 01:29 CST

* Some styling improvements, mainly based on more narrow paragraphs
  for improved readability.
* Fixed background gradients for some browsers that handled
  `transparent` strangely.
* Implemented a command to dump comments to json (for backup or debugging).
* Require `warp` 0.3.6, which handles results directly (so I can
  remove a wrapper function).
* Got rid of `rust_icu_ucol` dependency; collation belongs in database.
* Updated `pulldown-cmark` to 0.11.0, `syntect` to 5.2.0, `base64` to
  0.22.1, `clap` to 4.5.4, `i18n-embed-fl` to 0.8.0..


## Release 0.3.6
2023-12-21 14:43 CST

* Added a share on fediverse / mastodon button (PR #9).
* Removed twitter links.
* Note on old posts that they are old, and disable comments there.
* Refactored asset handling in server to a separate module.
* Somewhat improved logging, mainly in read-files subcommand.
* Some minor styling updates.
* Updated to `diesel-async` 0.4.1, `lazy-regex` 3.0.0, `ructe` 0.17.0,
  and `i18n-embed-fl` to 0.7.0.

  `accept-language` 3.0.1.


## Release 0.3.2
2023-02-28 20:20 CST

* Clean up diesel usage (PR #8).
  - Use `belonging_to` and (rust-side) `grouped_by` to replace 1+n
    queryes with 1+1 for loading tags on pages.
  - the `post_tags` relation table does not need a separate `id` column.
  - Use `Model::as_select()` instead of column tuples some places.
  - Don't select the year for a post separately when getting the `posted_at`.
* Limit the db pool to 20 connections (default is too large for my server).
* Make the decoration of the comment hr visible again.


## Release 0.3.0
2023-01-24 19:18 CST.

* Bugfix: Handle bilingual drafts (don't remove both before updating one).

  bike if there s room for it.
* Style addition: Add some illumination to initials (PR #7).
* Added common headers (including basic CSP).

  views becomes simpler by not needing the `interact` wrapper, but on
  the other hand all db access now needs a `&mut db` (PR #6).

  encoded as a png image in a data: url.

* read-files now handles keyword links (e.g. [term][wp]) correctly
  when the term is written across a line-break.
* Update content license to cc-by 4.0.
