# r4s - Rasmus blog engine

This is my new blog engine, written in Rust, using warp and a bunch of
awesome crates.  I should write more about it.

For the styling, I use some CC0 / Public Domain svg images I found on
<https://svgsilh.com/> and <https://openclipart.org/>,
and the [Cocanut typeface](https://fontesk.com/cokanut-typeface/) by
[Tapiwanashe Sebastian Garikayi](https://www.behance.net/sebgarrydesign).
